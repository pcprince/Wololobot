# Wololobot

An Age of Empires 2 Discord bot which plays original taunt sounds.

### Usage

First install Discord and the ability to join voice channels:
```
pip install discord.py
pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```
Then install ffmpeg:
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
Then add bot token to api_keys.py.

Finally, set the Discord bot's icon to `monk.png`. This is a very important step.
